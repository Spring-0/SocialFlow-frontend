## Project Overview

SocialFlow is a frontend application built using modern web technologies. Its purpose is to provide a user-friendly interface for connecting multiple social media platforms and performing data analysis. Although this repository contains only the frontend code, it is an integral part of the complete SocialFlow project.

The frontend utilizes JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, HTML, and React to deliver a responsive and interactive user experience. The interface will facilitate user authentication, social media account integration, data visualization, and various data analysis features.

**Please note:** This repository only contains the frontend code and does not include any backend functionality or API integration. The current version is under active development and may lack certain features or exhibit incomplete functionality.
